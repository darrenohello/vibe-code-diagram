This is where it gets interesting.

You’ve just articulated something important that isn’t fully encoded in the artefact yet:

> Some artefacts **start** as Think or Prove…
> and evolve into Multiply.

That evolutionary path is the missing conceptual layer.

Right now the model shows _levels_.
What you’re describing is _trajectory_.

That’s powerful.

# First: Is L5 “Multiply” actually earned?

Yes — but only if it clearly represents:

- Durable organisational capability
- Reduced dependency on specific individuals
- Increased execution velocity across teams
- Knowledge captured into systems

Your examples absolutely qualify:

### Email Design System

- Removes tribal knowledge
- Reduces onboarding friction
- Improves consistency
- Enables Marketing + Product

That’s textbook L5.

---

### KV Pilot Artefact

Started as:

- L1 Think (clarifying thinking)

Evolved into:

- L5 Multiply (sales enablement, customer education, internal clarity)

That evolution is extremely important.

---

### The Vibe-Coding Spectrum itself

Same pattern:

- Initially Think (you clarifying a mental model)
- Now Multiply (shared framework, language alignment, internal governance)

That’s not accidental.
That’s the pattern.

# The real difference between Ship and Multiply

You nailed it intuitively.

Here’s the clean distinction:

### L4 — Ship

- Production feature
- User-facing value
- Maintained code
- Within product constraints
- Team ownership

### L5 — Multiply

- Enables others to ship
- Reduces friction across teams
- Encodes knowledge into systems
- Scales thinking, not just features
- Often cross-functional

Ship produces product value.
Multiply produces organisational leverage.

That’s the clean separation.

Right now your artefact implies this — but it doesn’t _explicitly_ encode it.

---

# What’s Missing in the Artefact

What’s not yet visible:

> Artefacts can migrate right.

Right now the model reads as static:
“Choose the right level.”

But your lived examples show:
“Artefacts can evolve across levels.”

That’s sophisticated and worth capturing.

---

# How to Distill This Into the Artefact

You don’t want to clutter it.

So don’t add a new section.
Add a subtle reinforcement under L5.

Under “Multiply” you could add a micro-line like:

> Often evolves from Think or Prove into durable enablement.

Or:

> Some artefacts start as experiments and become shared systems.

Even cleaner:

> When an artefact becomes reusable across teams, it moves here.

That one line would encode everything you just said.

---

# You Could Also Strengthen the Watch-outs

Right now L5 watch-outs focus on:

- Tool sprawl
- Governance
- Discoverability

You might add one subtle conceptual guardrail:

> Don’t prematurely multiply — prove value first.

Because the failure mode is:

- Turning L1 experiments into L5 systems too early.

That ties the whole framework together.

---

# The Deeper Pattern (Worth Considering)

Your framework actually describes two dimensions:

1. Consequence / durability (left → right)
2. Reusability / leverage (Ship vs Multiply)

Multiply isn’t “more advanced Ship.”
It’s a different axis of value: organisational amplification.

If you wanted to go deeper later, you could:

- Make Multiply visually slightly distinct
- Or subtly indicate it spans horizontally across teams

But don’t overcomplicate it now.

---

# Does it resonate conceptually?

Yes.

It now captures:

- Cognitive scaffolding (Think)
- Experiential validation (Feel)
- Feasibility validation (Prove)
- Production delivery (Ship)
- Organisational leverage (Multiply)

That’s not hype.
That’s a maturity ladder.

And your real-world examples map cleanly.

---

# My Recommendation

Add ONE subtle reinforcement under L5:

> When an artefact becomes reusable across teams, it moves here.

That single sentence encodes:

- Email system
- KV pilot evolution
- This artefact itself
- Internal enablement tools

It’s elegant.
It won’t add cognitive load.
It strengthens the conceptual integrity.

If you’d like, I can now:

- Help refine the exact L5 copy so it feels sharper and earned
- Help write a 90-second workshop explanation of L5
- Or pressure-test the entire model with edge cases

Where do you want to go next?
